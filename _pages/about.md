* I am now pursuing Ph.D. from Newcastle University under the supervision of Prof. [Rajiv Ranjan](https://rajivranjan.net/), Prof. [Paul Watson](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/people/profile/paulwatson.html#background)  from [Newcastle University, UK](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/) and Dr. [Xiaoli Li](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/xlli/) from [I2R A* STAR, Singapore](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r). My research focuses on proposing innovative algorithms for run-time deployment of microservices in IoT environments.

* I am broadly interested in Cloud Computing, Internet of Things and Machine Learning. My current research focuses on designing a simulator for Edge Computing environment. I am also working on developing an Orchestrator for automatic benchmarking of web-application in containerized environment.

<!--I graduated from [Bhagalpur College of Engineering, Bhagalpur]() in 2012 and -->
I completed my M.Tech from [Jawaharlal Nehru University](https://www.jnu.ac.in/scss) in 2015 where I was advised by Prof. [Deo Prakash Vidyarthi](https://www.jnu.ac.in/content/dpv). My dissertation is about security prioritized resource provisioning in Cloud Computing.

<!--This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).-->

Research Interests
======
* I like exploring different system-specific problems.

* In particular I am interested in virtualization, Cloud platforms, IoT, optimization techniques, simulation, machine learning, networks and anything else that catches my fancy.


Searching for a Post-doctoral/ Research Scientist position to start from Fall 2020.
